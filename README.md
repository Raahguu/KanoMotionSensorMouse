# KanoMotionSensorMouse
A python project that aims to integrate with a KANO Coding Kit Motion Sensor

I realised that I had a "The Force (TM) Coding Kit Motion Sensor" by KANO.
And with how they rely on a piece of software that no longer works and as such are useless, I thought I might aswell play around with it and figure out my own way of interfaceing with it.

Then I came accross the great idea of using the KANO Motion Sensor as a mouse.

Controls:

```
Left: Tilt your hand left
Right: Tilt your hand right
Up: Tilt the end of your hand down
Down: Tilt the end of your hand up

Left Click: Get close to all four sensors with your hand
Right Click: Get close to all but the top sensor with your hand
```
